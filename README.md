# Cs125Project
A project for CS125, this is a murder mystery game with combat elements

Outline of the code:

# Start
- User is a detective and is investigating the murder of __
    - The story line will be set 
    - Indroduce the 5 suspects
    - Introduce the layout of where the murder happened(ASCII art)
- In a seperate function the murderer, room, and weapon will be decided (using RAND)

# Finding the Room: 
- User will explore each room, each will give a short description
    - The user will have to guess what room the murder happened 
       - If the user choses incorrectly, they must go through the remaining rooms for more information

# Finding the Weapon:
- User will explore what weapons are in the room that the murder occured
- The user will notice different things about each weapon
    - The user will have to guess the murder weapon
       - If the user guesses incorrectly then the murder will use that weapon in combat
  
# Finding the Person:
- User will interogate who they feel is nessecary (they can only interogate 3 out of 5 people)
- After this information is given a clue will appear to the user (doesn't depend if they interviewed the correct person)
    - The user will now guess the person
        - If the user guesses correctly they get an advantage in the fight (they begin the take-down)
        - If the user guesses incorrectly they get a disadvantage, the murderer attacks them first 

# The Fight:

# The Ending:
