The suspects start looking at you with confusion, the gaze at one another in anger, you can hear the bickering between all of them, upset by their friends death. 

"I will need all of your names for my list." All of them look at you with disgust, as if you were already accusing them of murdering their friend. 
"Ms.Blue"
"Mr.Mustard"


Mrs.White speaks up. "I know who did it." You look at them with confusion and hear them out,
"Ms.Scarlett did it, I saw them!", Ms.Scarlett replies back, "Of course it wasn't me why would I kill our dear friend!" 

You decide that listening to their comments would do you no good so you decide to move to investigating the surrounding room.
